Dataset generation and implementations for the paper HyperNetworks: Training Binary Neural Networks in Quantum Superposition https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08292 

Usage: Typically in all of our examples we first run jupyter notebook that generates an objective function through full enumeration.This is followed by a numerical simulation of a variational quantum algorithm  written in Julia and PastaQ: A Package for Simulation, Tomography and Analysis of Quantum Computers by Giacomo Torlai and Matthew Fishman (https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl/)
